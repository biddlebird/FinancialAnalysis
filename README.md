# Fraud Detection Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various transaction types, and fraudulent behavior is primarily observed in `TRANSFER` and `CASH_OUT` transactions. The analysis explores key patterns, feature engineering, and model performance evaluation.

## Key Findings
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** Only `TRANSFER` and `CASH_OUT` transactions exhibit fraud.
- **Imbalance in Old Balance Destination:**
  - **49.56% of fraudulent transactions** have `oldBalanceDest = newBalanceDest = 0`, despite a non-zero transaction amount.
  - **Only 0.06% of genuine transactions** exhibit this pattern, making it a strong fraud indicator.
- **Flagged Fraud Transactions:**
  - Transactions flagged as fraud have an `oldBalanceOrig` between **353,874 and 19,585,040**, indicating that only high-value transactions are flagged.
- **No Merchants in Key Fraud Pathways:**
  - Merchants do not appear in `CASH_IN` or `CASH_OUT` fraudulent transactions, suggesting effective filtering by fraud detection mechanisms.
- **Temporal Analysis:**
  - Some fraudulent `TRANSFER` transactions lead to genuine `CASH_OUTs` later, implying a possible delay in fraud detection.

## Feature Engineering Recommendations
- **`is_suspicious_destination`**: A feature to identify if a transaction destination is later involved in a genuine `CASH_OUT`.
- **Time-Based Features**: Analyzing transaction patterns across different time steps may reveal recurring fraud behaviors.
- **Enhanced Balance Features**: Examining deviations in account balances before and after transactions can improve detection accuracy.

## Handling Class Imbalance
- Since fraudulent transactions are a minority, consider **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance training data.
- Alternative fraud classification thresholds may improve recall without increasing false positives.

## Model Performance
- **AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve):** **0.9926**, indicating excellent fraud detection performance.
- Future enhancements could include hyperparameter tuning on:
  - `max_depth`
  - `learning_rate`
  - `colsample_bytree`

## Next Steps
- **Feature Refinement**: Introduce additional balance-related and behavioral features.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tune model parameters to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Convert the model into an API for live fraud detection.
